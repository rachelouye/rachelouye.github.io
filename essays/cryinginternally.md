## In the beginning 

I don't even know where to begin with IntelliJ and ESLint. Let me start by saying that I was enjoying the layout, structure, and how simple it is to code using these tools. Especially in software engineering, where there is a demand for efficiency and quality, implementing coding standards is almost essential for ensuring the success of functional code. Coding standards would definitely triumph over any other approach I have experienced so far in software engineering, as they are geared towards improving quality. The structured guidelines provided by coding standards establish formatting rules, and by adhering to these standards, I was able to ensure consistency across my codebase, allowing it to function properly.

## IntelliJ and ESLint

When reflecting on my experience with IntelliJ and ESLint, I found the adoption of coding standards to be beneficial. Not only was it beneficial, but I was most enlightened by how the workflow of ESLint provided a structured framework for evaluating my code quality and presenting a green checkmark. Seeing this green checkmark was incredibly liberating, especially in the stressful scenario of ensuring that my code works. As someone who strives for success, it almost felt like receiving validationâ€”a "good job, you did it" moment. I can firmly say that coding standards are a tool that will definitely make life easier in software engineering practices. Not only do they enhance the quality of code, but they also influence and encourage skill enhancement.

## What happened?!

Today, I experienced my first speed bump with ESLint. Seeing all the warning errors indicating an issue with running my code made me internally distressed. 

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" src="/img/coding standards1.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>

 I attempted to identify and highlight the issues, as well as understand the suggestions provided, but I had no idea what they were telling me to do. Clicking on the suggestions repeatedly yielded the same output. It's worth mentioning that I was under time pressure. I was confident, with a certainty of 99.99%, that my code was correct and would produce the expected output. 
 
<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" src="/img/coding standards2.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>

Therefore, I resorted to running the code in the browser, where I indeed obtained the desired result. To this day, I remain puzzled as to what the issue was and why I did not see the single green checkmark that would have verified my successful completion of the task.

## Marathon

This semester has been an intense marathon unlike any I've ever run before. Juggling 30 hours of work a week, three Computer Science classes, a move right before finals week, and personal issues has been incredibly challenging. Iâ€™ve never actually run a marathon, but after this semester, I believe I can do anything.

There are many components of software engineering that I had never imagined before taking this class. Initially, I thought software engineering was just about coding and creating whatever you wanted. One significant aspect is definitely the ethics in software engineering. Throughout this semester, I was able to use tools such as AI. Before this course, I had no experience with AI technologies like ChatGPT. In the generation I grew up in, we learned material in courses and applied that knowledge to demonstrate retention. I thought this semester would be my opportunity to learn how to use AI, and at first, I felt really uncomfortable using it. It almost felt like cheating, as if I was losing my authenticity in how hard I try to learn material. However, after understanding how AI works, it became more of a tool to save me time during my hectic life and to better understand concepts. However, I can see the ethical concerns involving the use of AI in software engineering, as it could potentially replace individual thinking and might even be used to help someone gain power unethically, not through their own knowledge and authenticity. This experience has taught me about the ethical concerns that are involved with software engineering.

## Marathon

This semester has been an intense marathon unlike any I've ever run before. Juggling 30 hours of work a week, three Computer Science classes, a move right before finals week, and personal issues has been incredibly challenging. Iâ€™ve never actually run a marathon, but after this semester, I believe I can do anything.

There are many components of software engineering that I had never imagined before taking this class. Initially, I thought software engineering was just about coding and creating whatever you wanted. One significant aspect is definitely the ethics in software engineering. Throughout this semester, I was able to use tools such as AI. Before this course, I had no experience with AI technologies like ChatGPT. In the generation I grew up in, we learned material in courses and applied that knowledge to demonstrate retention. I thought this semester would be my opportunity to learn how to use AI, and at first, I felt really uncomfortable using it. It almost felt like cheating, as if I was losing my authenticity in how hard I try to learn material. However, after understanding how AI works, it became more of a tool to save me time during my hectic life and to better understand concepts. However, I can see the ethical concerns involving the use of AI in software engineering, as it could potentially replace individual thinking and might even be used to help someone gain power unethically, not through their own knowledge and authenticity. This experience has taught me about the ethical concerns that are involved with software engineering.

Another component that can be applied to software engineering is Agile project management. This management style breaks down project components into units that can be addressed as deadlines approach. I believe it is comparable to running a marathon and taking breaks after completing a few miles. I experienced this through the development of my team's website, "Club Search Manoa." You can read more about it on my GitHub page here: [https://rachelouye.github.io/projects/manoaclubsearch.html]. Personally, I appreciate this management style because it allows team members to collaborate on how each part of the project will be executed and by when, as well as to evaluate what needs to be fixed or completed before the next phase. This approach can be applied in any project setting. For example, in a research environment, we can set goals for each member as the deadline approaches. Each member is tasked with a part of the project, allowing for collaborative completion of the research paper. This method is particularly flexible, especially when there are no set requirements and the goal is to produce a certain result.

After taking a course in software engineering this semester, I realized that many of these concepts can be applied to my current profession. Project management has definitely piqued my interest. Previously, my lack of experience led to a somewhat disorganized approach. However, this semester has enlightened me with a more organized method, enabling me to manage projects more effectively.

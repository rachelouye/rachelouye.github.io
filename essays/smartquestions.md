## Asking the "right" questions

Growing up I was always told there is no such thing as a not smart question. I was also always told that it’s better to ask questions then to not know at all. However, I was the type of person who grew up not asking questions because I was too shy, but I also did not want to sound unintelligent. Now, I have a completely different view on what is a question worthy of me asking.

## What not to ask
When thinking about a not smart question, I think of the most general form of what one would want an answer to. For example, if you are trying to ask a question regarding JavaScript, a question could be “How do you code in JavaScript?”.  

This is an example of what shows up when you ask stack overflow this question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=how+to+code+in+javascript&s=a686516c-2f51-46a0-b373-3359ae245d90).

When looking at a question specifically in the stack overflow that might not seem as smart would be something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13213928/how-to-make-a-class-in-javascript).

I can argue and say that is a question that some people would want to ask. Now one who actually knows how to code in JavaScript may say that “everyone knows how to make a class in JavaScript”, which would deem this question a not so smart question. However, looking at the response that was given it definitely does seem complicated, especially for someone who does not understand what classes are in JavaScript. Now this is where a smarter question would have to come into play, which would be geared more towards understanding and knowing what a smarter question would be regarding classes in JavaScript. 

## What to ask

When thinking about a smarter question, specifically asking a question regarding the topic would actually be more helpful.  A smarter question would be something like “What specific techniques can be used to define a class in JavaScript?”. The results would give something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/387707/what-techniques-can-be-used-to-define-a-class-in-javascript-and-what-are-their).

As we can see from the results, they are definitely not as general, and give specific results as to how to code for a class in JavaScript. The person who asked the question in that example gave specifics as to what they were looking for an answer regarding, and the results were very helpful. You can also tell by the amount of upvoates on both the questions and

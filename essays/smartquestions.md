Growing up, I was often advised that there are no unintelligent questions, and it's better to seek understanding through questions. However, my shyness sometimes held me back from asking questions, fearing that I might sound unintelligent. Over time, my perspective on what constitutes a worthwhile question has evolved, emphasizing the importance of asking questions that lead to meaningful insights.

## What Not to Ask
When considering an unintelligent question, there is a fine line of it being too general, especially for broad topics. For instance, a question like "How do you code in JavaScript?" lacks specificity and may be perceived as not smart. 
This is an example of what shows up when you ask stack overflow this question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=how+to+code+in+javascript&s=a686516c-2f51-46a0-b373-3359ae245d90).

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" src="/img/smart-questions/notsmart.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>


When looking at a question specifically in the stack overflow that might not seem as smart would be something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13213928/how-to-make-a-class-in-javascript).



The mentioned question, while seemingly straightforward, might be viewed as basic by those with JavaScript proficiency. However, the response received is complex, indicating the question's potential ambiguity. To improve, a smarter question should focus on specific aspects, like "What techniques define a class in JavaScript?" to yield more insightful results.

## What to Ask
A smarter question is one that delves into the specifics of a topic, providing clarity for both the asker and potential responders. Instead of a generic inquiry, a smarter question related to JavaScript might be "What specific techniques can be used to define a class in JavaScript?". 

The results would give something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/387707/what-techniques-can-be-used-to-define-a-class-in-javascript-and-what-are-their).


<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" src="/img/smart-questions/smart.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" src="/img/smart-questions/smart2.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>


The results from the smarter question are noticeably more tailored and informative. The asker's clear articulation of their query, along with the specifics about defining a class, garners more upvotes and demonstrates a higher level of engagement from the community.

## Outcome
Analyzing the two types of questions and their respective responses on Stack Overflow offers valuable insights. Smart questions are not only about seeking answers but also about framing inquiries in a way that promotes meaningful dialogue and efficient knowledge transfer.

Asking smart questions involves providing context, being specific about the problem, and tailoring inquiries to the intended audience. While there may not be universally unintelligent questions, there are undoubtedly more effective and efficient ways to seek information. This exercise has reinforced the idea that the art of asking smart questions is a skill that can be honed, leading to a more enriching experience for both the asker and the community at large.

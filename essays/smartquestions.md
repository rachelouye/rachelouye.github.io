## Asking the "right" questions

Growing up I was always told there is no such thing as a not smart question. I was also always told that it’s better to ask questions than to not know at all. However, I was the type of person who grew up not asking questions because I was too shy, but I also did not want to sound unintelligent. Now, I have a completely different view on what is a question worthy of me asking.

## What not to ask
When thinking about a not smart question, I think of the most general form of what one would want an answer to. For example, if you are trying to ask a question regarding JavaScript, a question could be “How do you code in JavaScript?”.  

Here is an example of what shows up when you ask stack overflow this question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=how+to+code+in+javascript&s=a686516c-2f51-46a0-b373-3359ae245d90).

When looking at a question specifically in the stack overflow that might not seem as smart would be something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13213928/how-to-make-a-class-in-javascript).

Now one who actually knows how to code in JavaScript may say that “everyone knows how to make a class in JavaScript”, which would deem this question a not so smart question. Now here is where a smarter question would have to come into play, which would be geared more towards understanding and knowing what a smarter question would be regarding classes in JavaScript. 

## What to ask

As you can see, there is no straight answer to the question that was asked. Instead, a smart question would be something like “How do you create an OOP class in javascript?”. The results would give something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=how+do+you+create+an+OOP+class+in+javascript).

As we can see from the results, they are definitely not as general, and give specific results as to how to code for an OOP class in JavaScript.

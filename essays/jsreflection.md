## JavaScript as the foreign language

Learning JavaScript is similar to mastering a foreign language, a skill mastered through countless hours of practice. Just as one cannot become fluent in a language overnight, this resonates with my experience growing up learning Japanese. In my childhood, my mother would converse with me in Japanese, and I had to gradually grasp the meaning of her words. Similarly, JavaScript is acquired through a comparable process where tasks are assigned, and one must respond with the appropriate code structure. Unlike my previous struggles with learning the language due to insufficient time commitment, this time, the aim is to implement JavaScript in simple scenarios, emphasizing practical application.

## Experience with JavaScript

Being relatively new to JavaScript and coding in general, my prior experience lies mainly with Java and C, both requiring meticulous attention to detail in lines of code. These languages also involve the additional step of compiling code, a process not required in JavaScript. The unique attribute of JavaScript being geared towards software engineering, particularly in web development, makes it a versatile and powerful tool in the realm of programming. However, the sturtcure is very similar to that of other coding languages, such as Java and C.

## Get good

Now, one might question: How can one successfully learn and practice JavaScript without a language partner for conversation practice? This is where the concept of "athletic software engineering" comes into play. As someone who enjoys exercising and being physically active, I find this approach appealing. It not only enhances my programming skills, which I admit are currently lacking, but also trains me to think quickly. The inherent time pressure is undeniably stressful given my limited knowledge, but it promises to be a marathon worth preparing for.

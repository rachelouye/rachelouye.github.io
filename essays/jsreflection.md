## JavaScript as the foreign language

JavaScript is like learning a foreign language, which is most definitely mastered upon many hours of practice. Not one person can learn a language overnight, and this is a concept I may relate to growing up learning Japanese. The way in which I learned Japanese was that my mother would speak to me in Japanese, and I would have to catch onto what she was saying. In a sense, JavaScript is learned in a similar manner where we are given a task, and we must respond with the proper outline of code. Previously, I had struggled learning the language in which there was not much time committed into understanding and learning the language. This time around, the goal is to be able to implement the language in simple scenarios. 

## Experience with JavaScript

I personally am very much new to JavaScript, let alone coding. My prior experience would only be with Java and C, which required much more attention to detail in lines of code. There were also the steps of having to compile your code, whereas JavaScript does not require that step. JavaScript tends to be geared towards programming for software engineering in a positive way, because the user may manipulate it to be for web development. Which in turn, deems it a handy and very powerful tool for software engineering.

## Get good

Now one may ask: *In what specific ways would one be successful at learning and practicing JavaScript? It’s not like we have a partner to practice speaking the language to.* That’s where athletic software engineering comes into play. Personally, I love exercising and being physically active so I find this concept to be extremely exciting. Not only does it train my programming skills (which I very much so lack), but also trains me to think fast. The time crunch is definitely stressful since my current knowledge is minimal, but will be a marathon worth training for.

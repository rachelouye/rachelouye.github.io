## How it started

Software engineering has always been an aspect of computer science that piqued my interest through the potential for innovation and problem-solving. The ever-changing nature of the field and its role in advancing technology fuel my motivation for pursuing a career in computer science. From an early exposure to programming languages like Java and C, I discovered the dedication to producing lines of code to bring simple coding ideas into play. This encounter sparked my curiosity and paved the way to the evolving world of software engineering.

## How it's going

In the future, I aspire to pursue careers in areas such as IT or web development, where the intersection of code and data can provide solutions and development to organizations. The aspect of creating systems that utilize coding to manipulate networks or websites excites me, and I see it as a path for innovation. Furthermore, I am still relatively new and open to developing skills in full-stack development, mastering both the front-end and back-end aspects of software engineering. This approach will not only broaden my proficiency but also provide confidence for me to contribute to software or even networking projects.

## How it happens

To accomplish these goals, I look forward to gaining hands-on experience through internships, collaborative projects, and real-world applications. This involves working on projects that address problems relative to software engineering and will provide me with the opportunity to apply my knowledge to practical scenarios. Additionally, I have been interested in participating in cyber defense competitions and collaborative coding initiatives to cater to improving my collaborative skills. These experiences will not only enhance my technical skills but also expose me to diverse perspectives and approaches in software engineering.

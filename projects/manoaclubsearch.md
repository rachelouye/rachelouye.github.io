## Being Social?!
During my first four undergraduate years at college, while pursuing a BS in Marine Biology, I found myself less social than I would have liked. I didn't join any clubs that could have helped me make friends, and most of my time at UH Manoa was spent attending classes out of necessity. This experience led me to think about creating an app where people could discover common interests with others and potentially make friends. This semester, I collaborated with four brilliant students to design a website that enables UH Manoa students to use their interests to socialize. The website we created is called “Club Search Manoa,” where users can log in to search for and browse clubs.

You can view more information about the website here: [https://clubsearch-manoa.github.io/].

## What Went Into It?
The website allows users to search and browse clubs, marking those that pique their interests as favorites. Users can also access contact information, descriptions, and meeting times of the clubs, helping them pursue social opportunities by joining meetings if they wish. Additionally, there are club administrators who can edit existing clubs, and super administrators who have the ability to add and delete clubs.

## Being Social?!
My first four undergraduate years of college was when I was pursuing a BS in Marine Biology. This time point of my life was when I was not as social as I wanted to be. I did not join and clubs that would have helped me to make friends, and most of my experience at UH Manoa was spent just going to my classes because I was required to. With this experience, I thought to myself why not have an app where people can find common interests with other people and potentially make friends. This semester I have worked with a group of four other brilliant students, in which I was able to take part in the design of a website that allows UH Manoa students to utilize their interests to be social. The website created is called "Club Search Manoa", where users are allowed to login and search and browse clubs. 

Here is a link to view the webpage on information about the website: [https://clubsearch-manoa.github.io/]

## What went into it?
The website consists of users being able to browse and search clubs, in which they are also able to favorite the ones that pique their interests. From there, users are also able to view contact information, a description, and meeting times of the clubs. This allows the user to be able to see what interests them, and then pursue being social if they would like to by joining the meeting times. Other than that, there is clubadmins who are allowed to edit already existing clubs, and superadmins who are allowed to add and delete clubs.

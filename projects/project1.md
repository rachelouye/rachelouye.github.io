summary: "Fluorescent in situ Hybridization of SAR11 from Kaneohe Bay"

## Background
 
  During my undergraduate years in Marine Biology, my interests involved research in Marine Microbiology. In the Summer of 2018, I took on a project for the Rappé Lab located at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe Bay. With this I gained experience in sampling methods, DNA extraction, flow cytometry, and fluorescent *in situ* hybridization (FISH). This project was completely done on my own with the guidance from my PI, Michael Rappé.
In efforts to cultivate SAR11 from Kaneohe bay, the objective of this project was to size fractionate sea water to accommodate for size, and apply FISH to enrich for SAR11 of sea water around Coconut island, Oahu. From this, SAR11 cells would have a confirmed presence without ambiguity for cultivation. Previously, cultivation was applied with frozen preserved samples of SAR11 from Kaneohe bay in time series, however failed to maintain growth. The hypothesis generated for this objective was that SAR11 marine bacteria can be enriched by size fractionation from Kaneohe Bay seawater. SAR11 cell counts were expected to be generated as a function of seawater size fractionation due to accuracy of methodology with FISH.

  However, due to time constraint and multiple instances of trial and error, the hypothesis that SAR11 cells could be enriched for through size fractionation could not be supported. Cell counts were not generated through FISH as expected. Each step in this project needed to be considered and evaluated, due to multiple factors affecting outcomes. In the path moving forward, pieces from this project would be applied to an even bigger project. This involves evaluating steps and using growing culture with confirmed presence of SAR11.

## Takeaway

  Prior to this project the Rappé Lab at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology had no protocol to perform FISH, as a protocol needed to be generated to accommodate for the lab’s working conditions. Being able to properly see Cy3 probe stained cells was hindered with speculation on a weak fluorescent microscope. Due to their lack of fluorescence, a stronger illuminator for the microscope would have been a possible fix. Despite the errors in molecular technique and technological malfunction, all of the steps of trial and error would help future efforts on performing FISH and cultivation of SAR11. The Rappé lab is now able to perform FISH readily through the newly generated protocol, and further study the ecological role of SAR11.

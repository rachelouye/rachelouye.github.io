## What is it?

From my first-grade through ninth-grade years, I dedicated myself in the practice of the Japanese martial art, Kendo. Also recognized as Japanese Fencing, this discipline involves the use of a bamboo sword called a "Shinai" for sparring against a partner or opponent. Despite dedicating nine years to Kendo, I eventually decided to explore other sports and hobbies. Kendo remained a passion I hoped to revisit, but the demands of a hectic schedule delayed my return. Then, one day, fate intervened; I approached an individual wearing a Kendo Gi (the traditional outfit) and inquired about the details of their training and Kendo practice. This encounter led me back to training, where I assumed the responsibility of revisiting enhancing my skills in the sport.

## Challenges

While Kendo wasn't a formal project, it served as a source of motivation to excel in all aspects of my life. Beginning at a low rank, my Sensei encouraged me to progress further. Advancement in ranks was challenged through tests encompassing sparring, kata, and a written component. My primary challenege involved finding comfort performing in front of an audience while executing techniques flawlessly. The rigorous hours of Kendo practice included participation in tournaments, which posed a mental challenge as I faced opponents with higher ranks who had been practicing Kendo since childhood.

## In the end

Ultimately, my dedication propelled me to achieve the rank of 1-dan, a status almost equivalent to a black belt in other martial arts. This commitment demanded time on weekends, while committing to a busy lifestyle. Despite a setback due to a severe injury that hindered further progress in sparring and tournament participation, I discovered a rare source of motivation in my life.

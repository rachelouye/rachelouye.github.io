## What is it?
During the years of my first grade through nineth grade, I took on the Japanese martial art, Kendo. This is also known as Japanese Fencing, in which you are given a bamboo sword called a "Shinai", to use to spar against a partner or opponent. However, after nine years, I decided to take on other sports and hobbies. Kendo was always one of those hobbies that I would have loved to get back into some day, but my time was not right due to a busy life schedule. Then one day it happened, I approached someone wearing Kendo Gi (the outfit that is worn) asking details on where they train and practice Kendo. From there, I ended up going back to train and take on the responsibility of working at a sport to become better at. 

## Challenges

While Kendo was not exactly a project, it was definitely a sport that motivated me to want to do better in everything I do. Intially, I started in a low rank, and that is when my Sensei wanted me to move up in rank. The ranks are given by the tests that are taken. These tests consists of sparring, kata, and a written test. The biggest challenege I faced was being comfortable performing infront of an audience while also being able to do the techniques correctly. Kendo consisted of hours of practice, in which I was able to participate in a tournament as well. This tournament really challenged me mentally, because I was going against people who are high rank and have been doing kendo since they were younger.

## In the end

Eventually I was able to work my way up to 1-dan which is almost equivallent to a black belt in other martial arts. This was decication that took out time of my weekened, when I do parttake in a very busy lifestyle. While I was not able to further in becoming better at sparring and participating in tournaments, due to a severe injury, I was able to find something that motivated me for once in my life.

## What is it?
During the years of my first grade through nineth grade, I took on the Japanese martial art, Kendo. This is also known as Japanese Fencing, in which you are given a bamboo sword called a "Shinai", to use to spar against a partner or opponent. However, after nine years, I decided to take on other sports and hobbies. Kendo was always one of those hobbies that I would have loved to get back into some day, but my time was not right due to a busy life schedule. Then one day it happened, I approached someone wearing Kendo Gi (the outfit that is worn) asking details on where they train and practice Kendo. From there, I ended up going back to train and take on the responsibility of working at a sport to become better at.
